The ability to rapidly and efficiently react and solve reported issues is in fact a key factor from the customers' perspective, resulting in positive feedback for the company, leading to higher economic and brand-image revenues. The automatic detection of failures from maintenance tickets and support requests can grant faster and more efficient reactions to customers' equipment failures as well as reduced maintenance costs. The analysis of support and maintenance requests is a well-known problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP). State-of-the-art solutions in this field rely on Transformers models, pre-trained on large text corpora, and then fine-tuned on the specific downstream task. However, due to their intrinsic nature, support requests are highly domain-specific and usually similar to short telegraph messages, where the focus is typically encapsulated in short sequences rather than in long dependencies. Hence, ad-hoc methods for pattern recognition might provide comparable performances with respect to Transformers. In this work, two alternative approaches are proposed, based on: Kernel Meth-ods in conjunction with Boost Decision Trees (SpectrumBoost), and Neural Networks for Multiple Representation Learning (DeepMRL). These models have been tested and compared against state-of-the-art models on a real-world set of 131305 maintenance tickets in the Italian language, suggesting that the proposed models outperform Transformers both in the prediction accuracy and in the time and computational resources required for their training.\n","tags":["Kernel Methods","Neural Networks","NLP","Industry"],"title":"Beyond Transformers: fault type detection in maintenance tickets with Kernel Methods, Boost Decision Trees and Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Agostini","Campese Stefano","Riccardo Vianello","Pizzi Marco","Cipriani Alberto","Zanetti MArco"],"categories":null,"content":"Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None.\nBackground Artificial Intelligence is an emergent tool in clinical practice for post processing of medical images. Machine Learning (ML) pipelines are created for data of interest extraction and algorithm application. A common issue in data extraction is represented by noisy datasets, like those of CMR studies, characterized by multiple images, acquired by different techniques, axis orientation and contrast timing. Purpose\nA ML pipeline for extraction of LGE images from raw DICOM data is presented. Additionally, steps for normalization of image number and automatically heart localization are outlined. Methods and Results\n642 consecutive CMR studies were analyzed.\nPipeline, Part 1. By looking at the metadata in raw files, ‘SequenceName’ tag was used to discard cine images, ‘ScanningSequence’ tag to select Gradient Recall and Inversion Recovery techniques (Inversion Time \u0026gt; 100 ms), ‘SequenceVariant’ tag to discard Steady State images (See Fig. 1). Orientation of the major axis was computed and ‘Axial’ or ‘Coronal’ images removed. Scans were grouped together by image orientation (requesting a min and max number of elements per group) and only the group with the largest number of files was selected. Finally, DICOMs were grouped by image shape (demanding a min number of elements), and only the series with the highest resolution was retained. Then, for each subject, the extracted series consists of a 3D-array (N,H,W), with N number of slices, and (H,W) image resolution. The attributes were not homogeneous between subjects.\nPipeline, Part 2. Given a desired final number of slices and resolution, the 3D-array was reshaped through a spline interpolation. In order to have a focus on the heart, a Region of Interest (ROI) extractor was implemented, based on a YOLO network for object detection. The network was applied on all the slices (Fig. 2); then the images were cropped by keeping the largest bounding box. This step allowed us to remove the background by only selecting the relevant ROIs. To manage the data more easily, images were saved as a NumPy Array, while other useful Dicom metadata (e.g. weight, age, …) were stored using the json standard.\nAt the end of the ML pipeline, images can be reduced to a common resolution and forwarded to ML algorithms.\nBy using this pipeline, a great amount of information not needed for LGE analysis can be discarded, granting a significant reduction in terms of data storage. In our series, the original dataset extended for about 200 GB; by requesting 10 slices per subject with a resolution of 128 by 128 pixels (also extracting heart ROI) the final dimension was reduced to 108 MB.\nConclusions In this work, we presented a post-processing pipeline for CRM images and LGE analysis. Given in input raw CRM the pipeline is able to (i) remove unuseful data, (ii) extract heart ROIs storing also Dicom metadata, (iii) normalize slices and image resolution, and (iv) store the processed CRM into ready-format for ML techniques.\n","date":1661212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661212800,"objectID":"31f559dabe0cf8a4f5867adf7d94cdb0","permalink":"https://agos95.github.io/publication/agostini-campese_esc2022-pipeline/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agostini-campese_esc2022-pipeline/","section":"publication","summary":"Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None.\nBackground Artificial Intelligence is an emergent tool in clinical practice for post processing of medical images.

Purpose\nIn this work, we tested two different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, namely kernel methods with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to a cohort of consecutive CMR studies. The goal was a binary classification task, aimed to identify myocardial scar (present/absent).\nMethods Dataset consisted of 642 CMR scans, equally divided into healthy and fibrosis-affected. Raw DICOM files were preprocessed through an automated pipeline, in order to retrieve only short-axis post contrast acquisitions. Heart regions were then individuated using a YOLO network, in order to remove the background and focus only on data of interest. Finally, for each subject 10 slices were extracted through interpolation, and all images resized to 128 by 128 pixels. Dataset was divided into training and test sets, with proportions 80%‐20%. Results\nThe first analysis was based on state-of-the-art CNN models, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The training of the models was optimized using “reduce learning rate on the plateau”, “early stopping”, and standard data augmentation techniques. Experiments showed that CNNs-based models led to poor performances.\nThe second attempt was based on kernel methods and SVM. Before feeding the input to the algorithm, dimensionality reduction was implemented using a Principal Component Analysis retaining 99% of the variance. The resulting 335 features were passed as input to an SVM, testing different kernels (e.g. Linear, Gaussian, Cossim). Models were trained and optimized using a Grid Search with a 5-fold Cross-Validation. The best SVM configuration displayed an accuracy of 68% and a sensitivity of 60%.\nImproved results could be obtained using state-of-the-art Multiple Kernel Learning algorithms, leading to 71% accuracy and sensitivity of 72% (with a 12% increment with respect to the previous algorithm).\nConclusions Our preliminary results of this study showed the possibility for a ML system to learn to identify myocardial fibrosis, directly from raw CMR images. In particular, kernel methods were able to achieve good and significant results, even with small amounts of data, suggesting room for improvement. In future works, we plan to furtherly explore kernel methods to improve the results and to build an end-to-end solution for cardiac imagers.\n","date":1661212800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661212800,"objectID":"4ba56677204a7e63b2318ec3dded3f96","permalink":"https://agos95.github.io/publication/agostini-campese_esc2022-analysis/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/agostini-campese_esc2022-analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: None.\nBackground Asserting the presence of myocardial fibrosis from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images is sometimes a complex task, even for experienced cardiac imagers.
